*[wp1_prefix]_formmaker_query*
*[wp1_prefix]_formmaker_sessions*
*[wp1_prefix]_formmaker_submits*

  * Choose the CSV file you need to view. You'll see a pop-up window with several options, you'll find the **File Origin** option along with them.

= I do not receive any submission emails of my forms. How can this be fixed? =

This might be a problem related to the hosting configurations of your website. You can check that the following way.

Please install [WP SMTP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smtp/) plugin and go to **Settings > WP SMTP** page. Scroll down to the bottom and send a test mail to your email address.

If the test email will be sent, then the issue is triggered by Form Maker plugin. Please contact [10Web Customer Care at WordPress.org Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/form-maker/). Our developers will have a closer look.

But if the test mail fails, the problem is on the server of your website. Please contact your hosting provider in this case, and ask them to enable mail functions on your site.

= My forms do not submit due to Javascript errors. How can they be eliminated? =

This problem could be related to permission settings of Form Maker files on your web server. Please check that the following way.

Connect to your website files via FTP connection and open the following two directories:

*wp-content/uploads/form-maker-frontend/js/*
*wp-content/uploads/form-maker-frontend/css/*

Please make sure all **.css** and **.js** files in these folders have their permissions set to **777.**

If the permissions are correct, please do not hesitate to contact [10Web Customer Care at WordPress.org Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/form-maker/).

= Is it possible to pass parameters from the page URL to form fields? =

To fill in values of parameters from a URL into Form Maker fields, it is necessary to implement a custom script. Please navigate to **Form Options > Javascript** page and add the following code inside **before_load()** function:

`function getParameterByName(name, url) {
   if (!url) {
      url = window.location.href;
   }
   name = name.replace(/[[]]/g, "$&");
   var regex = new RegExp("[?&]" + name + "(=([^&#]*)|&|#|$)"),
   results = regex.exec(url);
   if (!results) return null;
   if (!results[2]) return '';
   return decodeURIComponent(results[2].replace('/+/g', " "));
}
jQuery("#{{field_id}}").val(getParameterByName("{{param_name}}"));
jQuery("#{{field_id}}").attr("class", "input_active");`

Where **{{field_id}}** is the ID of the field you wish to prefill. Also, **{{param_name}}** is the name of the parameter in the URL.
