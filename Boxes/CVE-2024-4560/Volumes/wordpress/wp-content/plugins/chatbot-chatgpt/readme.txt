== API Key Safety and Security ==

Your API key serves as the confidential password providing access to your OpenAI account and the resources associated with it. If this key falls into the wrong hands, it can be misused in a variety of detrimental ways, including unauthorized usage, potential data leaks, and the improper application of AI models. It's crucial, therefore, to implement the following protective measures:

1. Secure key storage: Ensure your API keys are stored in a safe and secure manner.
2. Monitor and review usage: Frequently scrutinize and evaluate the usage of your API key. OpenAI provides handy usage data and records that can assist in detecting unusual activity. For insightful usage statistics, visit [https://platform.openai.com/account/usage](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage).
3. Establish usage limits: Initially, implement a low hard limit to ensure that if the limit is reached at any point during the month, any further requests will be denied. You can set up both hard and soft limits at [https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits).
4. Regular key rotation: Frequently changing your API keys can reduce the risk of misuse. If you observe any unexpected activity, it's important to immediately revoke your API keys. As a preventative measure, you might want to regularly revoke them to avert misuse. Manage your API keys at [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

Remember, wielding AI power requires immense responsibility — it's incumbent upon us all to ensure its careful and secure use.
