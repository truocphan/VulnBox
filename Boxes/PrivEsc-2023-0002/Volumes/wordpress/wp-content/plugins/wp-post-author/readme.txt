## Multiple authors byline support to the theme
If you’ve just installed WP Post Author, it will add a post author box with multiple authors under the content. You might notice that the bylines are being added in the backend but aren’t appearing on the frontend. You’ll need to add the function to your theme before the bylines will appear.

 We are also working for the enhancement of the feature.
