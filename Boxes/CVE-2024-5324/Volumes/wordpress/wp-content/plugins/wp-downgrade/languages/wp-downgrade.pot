"WP Downgrade allows you to either downgrade or update WordPress Core to an "
"arbitrary version of your choice. The version you choose is downloaded "
"directly from wordpress.org and installed just like any regular update. The "
"target version WordPress allows you to update to remains constant until you "
"enter a different one or deactivate the plugin either completely or by "
"leaving the target version field empty."
